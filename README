Kopfloss
headless, engine-agnostic JavaScript testing with QUnit
http://github.com/FND/kopfloss

GETTING STARTED

    # get dependencies (i.e. QUnit)
    $ make lib

    # run sample tests, using whatever JavaScript engine is available
    $ ./run.sh test/sample.js

CAVEATS

* tests must use QUnit.module rather than global module shortcut (for Node.js)
* not expected to _replace_ browser-based testing
* manual mocking expected - generic commonalities will gradually evolve as
  needed, enhancing the default set of fixtures
